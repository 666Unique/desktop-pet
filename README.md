# Simple Desktop Pet Based on Raspberry Pi Pico

> **Note**: This project is under construction, which may lead to inconsistencies between the documents and the code. Feel free to submit an ISSUE. The author might slack off anytime, but contributions (push requests) are always welcome.

This project demonstrates how to use a Raspberry Pi Pico and some basic hardware components to build a simple desktop pet. It aims to provide a beginner-friendly guide for hardware programming and embedded systems development through this Raspberry Pi Pico desktop pet.

The **minimum development cost** of this project is about 50 RMB. For example:

- By connecting to a computer via a UWB port, entering information will display emoticons on the screen along with some actions.

- You can also connect a **perception device**, like a radar ranging tool (additional cost: ~3 RMB), to sense surroundings and provide feedback to the computer. This will, however, make the code logic more complex. Both versions‚Äî**with radar** and **without radar**‚Äîare explained. Beginners can start with the radar-free version.

When the radar is not loaded, interaction is only possible via the computer. With radar, you can interact based on hand movements, as shown in these examples:

Refer to the documentation in the `docs` directory for installation details. If you encounter issues, check the "install-tips" guide (it‚Äôs highly recommended to read the notes before proceeding with wiring and servo installation!).
